A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, 
and another number. For example, 3 + 5. Create three variables, 
one for each part of the operation. Youâ€™ll use these variables to update your display later.

This is a little unclear for me.

The first thing it tells me that i need to add a var for a number, could be any number
The second is that i need to add a operator
The third i need to add another var for my second number.

* an operator is something that gets executed like '-', '+', '/', '*' etc.
* so i need to add these operators to a seperate var.

Create a new function operate that takes an operator and
two numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

* i need to create a function named operate
* the function need to take a operator(+/- etc)
* need to add two number that can get executed

solution
I have to add the correct function with the math function for simplicity i will go with add
 in the function operate(a, b ,operation) {
        return  operation (a,b)
 }
i was hardcoding my operate which caused my bug and not passing my argument as a param
